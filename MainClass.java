    5. Write a Java program to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence 
       from a given unsorted array of integers.
       Sample array: [49, 1, 3, 200, 2, 4, 70, 5] 
       The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], therefore the program will 
       return its length 5.
    
    6. Write a Java program to remove the duplicate elements of a given array and return the 
       new length of the array.
       Sample array: [20, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 50]
       After removing the duplicate elements the program should return 4 as the new length of the array.

    7. Write a Java program to convert all the characters in a string to lowercase.

    8. Write a Java program to create a character array containing the contents of a string.

    9. Write a Java method to check whether a string is a valid password.
       
       Password rules:
               A password must have at least ten characters.
               A password consists of only letters and digits.
               A password must contain at least two digits.
